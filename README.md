MSBuild Tasks
=============

This repo contains examples of how to build MSBuild tasks that run on both "msbuild.exe" (inside Visual Studio 2017) and
with "dotnet.exe" (.NET Core CLI on Windows, Linux, and macOS).

To run this sample,

1. Install .NET Core CLI 1.0.0-rc4-004767 or greater. See <https://github.com/dotnet/cli> for download links.
2. Run build.ps1 (Windows) or build.sh (macOS, Linux)
